# PlayingWShellcode
Artifacts from working on executing shellcode & process injection/hooking

## Status

**This is not production code.** Hopefully I will take the time to get this fully functional and modular. Until then, it's here as a reference.

## Roadmap/TODO
#### One-Time
- [ ] Debug remote process injection
- [ ] Clean up mess (from hotswapping code and debugging)
- [ ] Modularize functions + make a proper .h file
#### Continuous
- [ ] Find/implement/support new TTPs & attacks
